1.What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

Ans: getElementById return a single element with specific id.
getElementsByClassName returns html collection of all elements with className
querySelector returns the first element that matches the css selector
querySelectorAll returns nodeList of all element that matches the css selector

2.How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

Ans:In the DOM, a new element is first created using document.createElement("tagName").
For example, a div or p can be created. After that, we can add text or HTML content
to the element using textContent or innerHTML. Similarly, we can assign an id or className
to the element for identification or styling purposes. Once the element is created, we can
insert it into the DOM using appendChild() to add it at the end of a parent element.

3.What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?

Ans:Event Bubbling is a process in the dom where an event is triggered on a child element
first runs its handler,then bubbles up to its parent elements,triggering their handlers.
Let's assume a button inside a div,the click event first trigger on the button then on the div

4.What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Ans:Event Delegation is basically a process to handle events efficiently.
Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element,
we can add an event listener to a parent element and call an event on a particular target
using the .target property of the event object. It is useful because it improves performance,reduces memory usage.

5.What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?

Ans:preventDefault() stops the default action of an event
stopPropagation() prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements
